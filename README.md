POWER_LED is a unique take on the traditional panel mounted LED design, utilising a PCB and reverse mount LED it can be flush mounted to any internal surface and provide excellent visibility to the external environment. 
It was originally designed as a power indicator light for combat robots, but is ideal for any application that requires a small panel-mount LED.

Designed and built in [Christchurch, New Zealand ](https://www.google.co.nz/maps/place/Christchurch+New+Zealand) by Connor Benton, visit [CB-Technology](https://www.cb-tech.co.nz/) for details.
